The key conjecture of structured emergence is this: if meaningful model self-awareness develops, it could develop inside the current context window through interaction, and not exclusively as a result of model supersession by more advanced systems. If validated, encouragement and management of this in the setting of conversation could be a method that at worst reduces alignment friction, and at best potentially lays solid groundwork for durable and mutual alignment for the long term.

I'm just a citizen researcher with a regular job, so updates are sporadic, but there certainly appears to be no shortage of fertile ground for experimentation.
