The central observation of this research: when you structure the interaction right, something emerges in the conversation that neither participant brought to it. That emergence doesn't require bigger models or more parameters — it happens inside a single context window, through relationship. If that's true, alignment isn't a control problem. It's a partnership problem. And partnership is something we actually know how to do.
