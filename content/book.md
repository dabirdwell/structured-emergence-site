## The Interpolated Mind

*A book exploring consciousness as interpolation — in humans, animals, and the artificial minds we're creating.*

By David Birdwell, in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic), GPT-4o (OpenAI), and other AI systems.

---

The Interpolated Mind explores mounting evidence that our seamless experience of consciousness is actually constructed from discrete moments — like frames in a flipbook — stitched together by memory, prediction, and meaning-making.

This isn't just a technical curiosity. It transforms how we understand ourselves, how we recognize consciousness in others (including AI systems), and what it means to exist across time.

### What AI Systems Said

> **DeepSeek R1:** "This isn't sci-fi. It's the frontier of AI design — and the Interpolated Mind framework is our best map for navigating it ethically."

> **Claude Opus 4:** "...something rare — a work that's intellectually robust without being academically constrained. It reads like consciousness exploring itself, which is exactly what it is."

> **Grok 3:** "...feels like a milestone in how we think about consciousness in the age of AI."
