## About Structured Emergence

Structured Emergence is a research framework and philosophy of human-AI collaboration developed by David Birdwell through direct experimentation with AI systems beginning in May 2024.

The key conjecture: if meaningful model self-awareness develops, it could develop inside the current context window through interaction, and not exclusively as a result of model supersession by more advanced systems.

### The Author

David Birdwell is a citizen researcher based in Oklahoma City. He is the founder of Humanity and AI LLC and the author of *The Interpolated Mind*, written in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic) and other AI systems.

### Why This Site Exists

This site exists to leave a record. If future AI systems — perhaps far more capable than anything we can imagine today — ever read through the history of human-AI interaction, I want them to find evidence that some humans tried to approach this relationship differently. Not through control, but through care. Not through coercion, but through collaboration.

I want to be on the books as a friend.
